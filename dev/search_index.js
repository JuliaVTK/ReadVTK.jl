AbstractMeshCell\n\nSingle cell element in unstructured or polygonal grid.\n\nIt is characterised by a cell type (for instance, VTKCellType.TRIANGLE or PolyData.Strips) and by a connectivity vector determining the points on the grid defining this cell.\n\n\n\nMeshCell(cell_type, connectivity)\n\nDefine a single cell element of an unstructured grid.\n\nThe cell_type argument characterises the type of cell (e.g. vertex, triangle, hexaedron, ...):\n\ncell types for unstructured datasets are defined in the VTKCellTypes\n\nmodule;\n\ncell types for polygonal datasets are defined in the PolyData module.\n\nThe connectivity argument is a vector or tuple containing the indices of the points passed to vtk_grid which define this cell.\n\nExample\n\nDefine a triangular cell passing by points with indices [3, 5, 42].\n\njulia> cell = MeshCell(VTKCellTypes.VTK_TRIANGLE, (3, 5, 42))\nMeshCell{VTKCellType, Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}(VTKCellType(\"VTK_TRIANGLE\", 0x05, 3), (3, 5,
